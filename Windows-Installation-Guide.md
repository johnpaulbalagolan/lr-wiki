# Introduction

There are two recommended approaches to get a new Learning Registry node running using the latest stable code: 1) via an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) or 2) via installing the code.

Instructions for using an existing AMI are available from http://goo.gl/fhdg3.

The installation instructions below the steps to get a new Learning Registry node running using the latest stable code. These instructions are provided for Windows and have been tested with the Windows 7 64-bit environment. 

_NOTE: Some code changes had to be made for Windows' machines. Once these have been fully tested and published the doc will be updated to grab the changes to ensure a successful installation._
