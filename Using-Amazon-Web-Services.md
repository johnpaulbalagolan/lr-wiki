# Using Amazon Web Services to Install an LR Production Node

If you're looking to use a pre-built image to launch a new LR node instance quickly, please view the **Deploying an LR AMI** [document](http://goo.gl/PM9cR). The document also includes a list of the existing AMIs and the most current AMI to use.

The **Installing a Learning Registry Production Node using Amazon Web Services** [document] (https://docs.google.com/a/adlnet.gov/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0ByJYdR0YE41yOWRmNTcxNGYtOTJlNy00ZTk5LTlhMTItMzA4NWMzMTM2NjBm&hl=en_US) provides instructions on how to create an LR node from a base Ubuntu AMI, use the base installation to create a new AMI as a template for more EC2 images, and how to use a pre-built image to launch new LR node instances.
