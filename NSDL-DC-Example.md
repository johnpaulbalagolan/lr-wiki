NSDL_DC is a widely used metadata format.  Many of the resources found in the Learning Registry use this format.  Here is a link to learn more about the NSDL_DC format: http://nsdl.org/contribute/metadata-guide

Here is an example record in the Learning Registry that uses NSDL_DC: https://node01.public.learningregistry.net/harvest/getrecord?by_doc_ID=t&request_ID=00031c9545e5430aaf407889c98de376

Captured below is the actual NSDL_DC XML record contained in the example linked to above:

  <dc:description>This essay with a field-journal focus describes an expedition that was imagined to be a combination of a day at the beach and an educational orientation to oceanography. The author learned about how a barrier island moves landward and upward in space and time and why Sandy Hook, now a barrier spit, has at times been two or three separate islands over the past 250 years. There is also a vivid and humorous description of the difficulties the author and her group faced when trying to collect samples of ocean water and bay water to take dissolved oxygen readings. They were trying to find out which has more oxygen, ocean water that has been aerated by turbulence, or bay water that has been fed by oxygen-producing plants? This ninth-grader from New Jersey learns that getting the answer is not all that easy.</dc:description>
