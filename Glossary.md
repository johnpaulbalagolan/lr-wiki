It includes informally authored information and data obtained directly through monitoring the use of a learning resource, its metadata or its paradata.  Also denoted second party metadata.

* **Payload** - The resource data relative to the envelope describing it.  It can be placed in the envelope "inline" or it can be "linked" to the envelope by a locator.
* **Resource** - See learning resource.
* **Resource Data** - Any data that describes a learning resource, including, but not limited to metadata and paradata.
* **Resource Data Type** - A label describing the type of resource the resource data describes.  It is defined as an open (best practices) vocabulary ["metadata", "paradata", "resource", "assertion", ...]
* **Sign** - Adding an OpenPGP (RFC 4880) digital signature to a submitted document (metadata, paradata, etc.) to validate the authenticity of the submitterâ€™s identity and the integrity of the document.
