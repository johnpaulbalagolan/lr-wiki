### Get Alignment Data

1. Jacob wants to harvest all the data aligning educational resources to educational standards that is available in well-known formats (e.g., [NSDL_DC](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Alignment%20DC%20Example), [Paradata 1.0](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Alignment%20Paradata%20Example)) so he can integrate the data into his local application.
1. Emily is looking at a resource on a web page and wants to know which curricular standards are aligned with the resource.
1. Michael is creating a web page in a state educational portal for resources and wants to be able to get the curricular standards that are aligned with the resource.
1. Madison is creating a web page in a state educational portal for resources and wants to be able to get the curricular standards that are aligned with the resource by a known set of qualified sites.
1. Joshua is looking at a curricular standard on a web page and wants to know all of the educational resources that are available, which are aligned to the standard.
1.  Grizzly wants to build a website to make it easier for computer science majors at a university to find resources vetted by other students for assistance in preparing for assignments and examinations.  He would like students to be able to browse by sub-topic, user rating, and possibly course name.  He would also like registered students to tag useful public resources with minimal effort and store the tags in the learning registry.
1.  The State of Florida portal (http://floridastandards.org) currently enables users to browse content related to a math or science standard.  The portal has only been funded to support math and science standards.  The portal does not currently appear to be using the Learning Registry.  However, its seems there would be an opportunity to enable users to browse content related to language arts or science standards using data from the Learning Registry.  I would imagine the portal would want to limit related content to content, metadata, and paradata published from trusted organizations.
