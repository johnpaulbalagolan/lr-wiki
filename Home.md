Welcome to the Learning Registry wiki! The Learning Registry makes digital learning resources easier to **find**, easier to **access** and easier to **integrate** into learning environments _wherever_ they are stored -- around the country and the world. This will enable teachers, students, parents, schools, governments, corporations and non-profits to **build** and **access** better, more interconnected and **personalized learning solutions** needed for a 21st-century education. You can find more information on the Learning Registry project at the [Learning Registry Web Site](http://learningregistry.org).

## Getting Started

The [Learning Registry in 20 Minutes or Less](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nvvm5ClvLxSWptlo52rTwIDvobiFylYhWLVPbVcesU/edit?hl=en_US) guide will get you rolling with creating, uploading, downloading, and verifying envelopes in and out of Learning Registry servers whether you're using Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.

## Developer Basics

The [Learning Registry Quick Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bq_69wnnQJ56O6jyLK2C_fcp-Ovb7MYxXUXD0Rl1Mag/edit?authkey=CK7k5r8F&hl=en_US&authkey=CK7k5r8F) provides a brief reference to the principal data structures and services with which typical developers using the Learning Registry will most frequently interact.

* [Sandbox](http://sandbox.learningregistry.org) - Test applications developed with the Learning Registry API in a simulated environment.

* [Examples](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Examples) - A page for sharing examples (metadata, paradata, queries).

* [Known Nodes](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Known-Nodes) - A list of known LR nodes.

* [Publishing guidance using OAI-PMH](http://goo.gl/yOihy) - A short Google Doc with code examples and links to working code projects to pull data from OAI-PMH repositories and push the data into the Learning Registry.

* If you are publishing data, we recommend publishing documents in batches of 100 documents in each publish post.  Each batch of 100 documents should take less than 10 seconds to publish.

## Setting Up an LR Node

There are two recommended approaches to get a new Learning Registry node running using the latest stable code.  The current version of the code implements the [Learning Registry Technical Specification v0.23.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRbDpM0BKvNc4WzDzX0pNUpfPtFAsKpKGnOyRhRok-8/edit?hl=en_US).  The first approach is to setup an LR node using an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI).  The second approach is to install a new LR node on a Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X machine following installation instructions.
