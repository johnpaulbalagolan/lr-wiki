Welcome to the Learning Registry wiki! You can find more information on the Learning Registry project at the [Learning Registry Web Site](http://learningregistry.org).

* [Glossary](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Glossary)

* [Common Data Schema Formats in Learning Registry](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Common-Data-Schema-Formats-in-Learning-Registry) - Examples of common data schema formats used in Learning Registry. Note: LR is data schema agnostic.

* [Known Nodes](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Known-Nodes) - A list of known LR nodes.

## Publishing Resources

* **Publishing using OAuth and Node Signing** - Code samples showing how to publish to a node with Node Signing capabilities enabled.
  * [in Python](https://gist.github.com/3874176)
  * [in Ruby](https://gist.github.com/4708906)

* [Sandbox](http://sandbox.learningregistry.org) - Test applications developed with the Learning Registry API in a simulated environment.

* [Publishing guidance using OAI-PMH](http://goo.gl/yOihy) - A short Google Doc with code examples and links to working code projects to pull data from OAI-PMH repositories and push the data into the Learning Registry.

> If you are publishing data, we recommend publishing documents in batches of 100 documents in each publish post.  Each batch of 100 documents should take less than 10 seconds to publish.

## Setting Up an LR Node

There are two recommended approaches to get a new Learning Registry node running using the latest stable code.  The current version of the code implements the [Learning Registry Technical Specification v0.50.1] (http://docs.learningregistry.org/en/latest/spec/Technical_Spec/index.html).  The first approach is to setup an LR node using an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI).  The second approach is to install a new LR node on a Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X machine following installation instructions.

* [AMI Installation](https://docs.google.com/a/adlnet.gov/document/d/1XxEyv1y6Nv2ELTPAoS7l3UHwjuwg7Q981xGbQ-5v6yQ/edit?hl=en_US) - Instructions for setting up a node using an existing Amazon Machine Instance.  

* [List of AMIs](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Current-AMI-Instances) - List of currently available LR Amazon Machine Instances (AMIs).

* [Linux Installation](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Linux-Installation-Guide) - Instructions for setting up a node on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS onwards.

* [Windows Installation](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Windows-Installation-Guide) - Instructions for setting up a node on a Windows 7 64-bit environment.

* [OS X Installation](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Proposed-OS-X-Installation-Instructions) - Instructions for setting up a node on Mac OS X.

* [PlugFest2 Virtual Machine](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/PlugFest2-Virtual-Machine) - Jim distributed LR Virtual Machines at the PlugFest2 event loaded with an LR node instance and various tools.

* [Upgrading a Node](https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/wiki/Upgrading-a-Node) - Instructions for upgrading a node to the latest release.
