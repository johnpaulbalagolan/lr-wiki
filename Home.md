Welcome to the LearningRegistry wiki! You can find more information on the Learning Registry project at [Learning Registry Web Site](http://learningregistry.org).

The [LearningRegistry Git Repository](https://github.com/LearningRegistry) is the code base for the project. Current version of the code implements [Draft Learning Registry Technical Specification V 0.21.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191BTary350To_4JokBUFZLFRMOEfGYrl_EHE6QZxUr8/edit?hl=en#). The code implements a Learning Registry (LR) node with the following web services enabled: 

* Publish
* Obtain
* Harvest
* OAI-PMH Harvest
* Status 

### Setting Up an LR Node
Instruction for setting up an LR Node on Ubuntu 10.04 onwards and MacOS 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) can be found at <https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/blob/master/README.md>. The instructions are for manually setting up a node as well as for automatically installing all software necessary for node setup. The master branch of the source tree is the most stable version and should be used by people trying to setup a node for the first time. 

The Learning Registry Project maintains a node at [LRTest01](http://lrtest01.learningregistry.org) for users trying to integrate with the LR service APIs. LR web services can be accessed by sw clients written in any programming language and [LRTest01](http://lrtest01.learningregistry.org) can be used to publish and access resource data using the LR service APIs from the client. 

### LR Services user guide
[Learning Registry in 20 Minutes or Less](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nvvm5ClvLxSWptlo52rTwIDvobiFylYhWLVPbVcesU/edit?hl=en_US) is a quick start guide for publishing and accessing signed data to and from an LR node.
