### Setting Up an LR Node
Instruction for setting up an LR Node on Ubuntu 10.04 onwards and MacOS 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) can be found at <https://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry/blob/master/README.md>. The instructions are for manually setting up a node as well as for automatically installing all software necessary for node setup. The master branch of the source tree is the most stable version and should be used by people trying to setup a node for the first time.
