There are two ways you can contribute to the Learning Registry:
* by fixing/augmenting/improving the LR core code itself 
* modules and extensions for existing systems integration or features not defined by the Technical Specification

We will provide an overview of both methods, as well as guide you on how to best sync with our current workflow.

## LR Core

The LR core codebase on Github is not intended for changes to be pushed to directly. We are currently using the "fork + pull" model for contributing code. If you are not familiar with this way of contribution, we suggest you read this overview before moving forward with serious LR development: http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/.

### Suggested Workflow:
1. Fork the LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry repository. Make sure that you don't unwatch the original.
2. Clone your fork locally and add a remote. 
3. For each feature that you are working on, create a branch and do the work in that branch.
4. When you are finished with a feature, merge the branch into your forked master.
5. Issue a pull request to the original LearningRegistry repository. The core team will perform a code review and, based on feedback, ignore the request or merge it into the current master branch.
