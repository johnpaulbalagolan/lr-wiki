# LR Core

The LR core codebase on Github is not intended for changes to be pushed to directly. We are currently using the "fork + pull" model for contributing code. If you are not familiar with this way of contribution, we suggest you read this overview before moving forward with serious LR development: http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/.

### Suggested Workflow:
1. Fork the LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry repository. Make sure that you don't unwatch the original.
2. Clone your fork locally and add a remote. 
3. For each feature that you are working on, create a branch and do the work in that branch.
4. When you are finished with a feature, merge the branch into your forked master.
5. Issue a pull request to the original LearningRegistry repository. The core team will perform a code review and, based on feedback, ignore the request or merge it into the current master branch.
